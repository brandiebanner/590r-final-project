This repository belongs to **Brandie Banner Shackelford**.

It is my final project for **EPI590R**, taken at Emory University in **2025**.

Data credit: I took data from tidytuesday. It contains data from UNHCR, UNRWA, and the internal displacement monitoring centre (IDMC) on displacement from 2010-2022.

Run "read in refugee data 590R.R" and then render "Displacement Analysis EPI590R Shackleford.qmd".
